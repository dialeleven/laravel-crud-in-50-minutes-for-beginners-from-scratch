Expanding upon the Laravel CRUD tutorial which has been completed (marked as a 1.0 release). What's next?

- Styling UI with :white_check_mark:CSS or possible frameworks (e.g. Tailwind CSS, Vue)
- Login check for entire CRUD app
- User login page
- User forgot password page
- Reset password page
- Image uploads (:white_check_mark:full size, thumbnails?)
- Validation (email address, URL slugs, [A-Za-z0-9], etc)
